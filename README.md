# easyparser

easyparser is a library that parses Go code and returns information about top-level identifiers.

The analyzed identifiers are:
 
 * Constants
 * Variables
 * Functions
 * Structs
 * Interfaces

The library is quick and easy to use and useful for simple cases, but definitely not as powerful as reading a syntax tree built with `go/ast`.

# State

This is a work in progress.
